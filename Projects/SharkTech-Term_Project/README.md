# 301-Term_Project

## Project Objectives:

- Develop as a team a singular Powershell script that, when executed on a new installation of Windows Server, can fully standup all requisite services to make the server into a DC. Minimum required components of the script are listed in the Project Guidelines document (see attachment). Each individual of the team is to contribute their share of the overall script and document their individual contribution. The final script should reflect an equal effort from all team members.

- For the purposes of this project, only a single Windows 10 endpoint is required for demonstrating synchronization with the domain._

We also wish to host somes infrastructure on AWS EC2. A client-server VPN configuration will prove necessary to facilitate secure remote authentication to AWS EC2 resources.

- Objective: Build a working client-server VPN loadout from AWS EC2. Successfully connect a Windows 10 client to the AWS VPC. Demonstrate access to resources on AWS.

We have also experienced a number of network intrusions in the past which has caused management to be concerned with the idea of sharing LAN resources with AWS EC2.
We need to implement some form of network access control that provides a healthy level of AAA security management on their local on-prem LAN. Your upcoming presentation should demonstrate evidence of AAA in your final configuration.

- Objective: Deploy a RADIUS system that raises a captive portal for new network users and authenticates them using AD credentials.
